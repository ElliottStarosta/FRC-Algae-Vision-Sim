## Problem Statement

We have two entities in a 2D plane:
1. **Robot**: Can accelerate toward its target with a limited maximum acceleration and maximum velocity
2. **Algae**: Moves with an initial velocity and may decelerate over time

The challenge is to predict whether and when the robot can intercept the algae, and to guide the robot along an optimal path to achieve this interception.

## Interception Calculation

### Key Constraints
- Robot has a maximum acceleration (a_r)
- Robot has a maximum velocity (v_max)
- Algae moves with initial velocity (v_a) and may decelerate at rate (a_a)
- Both entities follow proper 2D physics (position, velocity, acceleration vectors)

### Interception Cases

The calculation handles three primary cases:

1. **Algae stops before interception**: The robot must reach the algae's final resting position
2. **Interception during algae motion**: The robot must solve for a future meeting point while both are moving
3. **Fast algae, no interception possible**: When algae velocity exceeds robot capabilities and relevant vectors indicate no intercept

## Motion Equations

### Robot Motion

For a robot with position r(t), velocity v_r(t), and acceleration a_r(t):

1. Acceleration toward target:
   ```
   a_r(t) = a_r * unit_vector(algae_pos - robot_pos)
   ```

2. Velocity update with maximum constraint:
   ```
   v_r(t+dt) = min(||v_r(t) + a_r(t)*dt||, v_max)
   ```

3. Position update:
   ```
   r(t+dt) = r(t) + v_r(t)*dt
   ```

### Algae Motion

For algae with position a(t), velocity v_a(t), and deceleration a_a:

1. Velocity update:
   ```
   v_a(t+dt) = v_a(t) - a_a * unit_vector(v_a(t)) * dt
   ```
   (where a_a is only applied if algae has non-zero velocity)

2. Position update:
   ```
   a(t+dt) = a(t) + v_a(t)*dt
   ```

### Algae Final Position (When It Stops)

If algae has deceleration a_a > 0:

1. Time to stop: 
   ```
   t_stop = ||v_a(0)|| / a_a
   ```

2. Distance before stopping:
   ```
   d = ||v_a(0)|| * t_stop - 0.5 * a_a * t_stop^2
   ```

3. Final position:
   ```
   a_final = a(0) + unit_vector(v_a(0)) * d
   ```

## Prediction Algorithm

The simulation uses a two-part approach for interception prediction:

### 1. Analytical Solution (when possible)

For the case where algae comes to rest:

```python
# Calculate time for algae to stop
t_stop_algae = algae_speed / a_a

# Calculate algae final position
algae_dir = algae_vel / algae_speed
stop_distance = algae_speed * t_stop_algae - 0.5 * a_a * t_stop_algae**2
algae_final_pos = algae_pos + algae_dir * stop_distance

# Calculate time for robot to reach that position
intercept_time, intercept_point = calculate_time_to_position(
    robot_pos, robot_vel, algae_final_pos, a_r, v_max
)
```

### 2. Numerical Solution (for complex cases)

When analytical solutions are intractable (e.g., both entities moving with various constraints), the simulation uses numerical integration:

```python
while t < max_time:
    # Update positions and velocities using physics equations
    robot_vel += direction_to_algae * robot_acc * dt
    robot_vel = limit_to_max_velocity(robot_vel, max_vel)
    robot_pos += robot_vel * dt
    
    algae_vel = apply_deceleration(algae_vel, algae_decel, dt)
    algae_pos += algae_vel * dt
    
    # Check for interception
    if distance(robot_pos, algae_pos) < threshold:
        return intercept_found
    
    # Track minimum distance
    update_minimum_distance()
    
    t += dt
```

## Optimal Navigation

After calculating the interception point, the simulation uses a guidance algorithm to navigate the robot efficiently:

### Time-To-Go Proportional Navigation

For each time step:

1. Calculate the remaining time to interception:
   ```
   time_remaining = intercept_time - elapsed_time
   ```

2. Calculate the optimal velocity needed to arrive exactly at intercept time:
   ```
   desired_speed = min(distance_to_target / time_remaining, max_velocity)
   ```

3. Calculate desired velocity vector:
   ```
   desired_vel = direction_to_target * desired_speed
   ```

4. Calculate required acceleration:
   ```
   accel_vec = (desired_vel - current_vel) / dt
   ```

5. Apply acceleration limits:
   ```
   if ||accel_vec|| > max_acc:
       accel_vec = accel_vec * (max_acc / ||accel_vec||)
   ```

This guidance law ensures the robot arrives at the interception point at exactly the right time, rather than just heading toward the current algae position.

## Mathematical Proof of Interception Calculation

### Case 1: Algae comes to rest

If algae decelerates to a stop, we need to prove the robot can reach the final position:

1. For algae stopping at position p_stop at time t_stop:
   ```
   p_stop = p_a(0) + v_a(0)*t_stop - 0.5*a_a*t_stop^2 * unit_vector(v_a(0))
   ```

2. For robot with zero initial velocity traveling to p_stop:
   - Time to reach max velocity: t_max = v_max/a_r
   - Distance during acceleration: d_acc = 0.5*a_r*t_max^2
   - If distance to target < d_acc:
     ```
     t_intercept = sqrt(2*distance/a_r)
     ```
   - Otherwise:
     ```
     t_intercept = t_max + (distance - d_acc)/v_max
     ```

3. Interception possible if:
   ```
   t_intercept > t_stop
   ```

### Case 2: Both objects in motion

This case requires solving a pursuit-evasion differential equation system. For constant velocities, we solve:

```
robot_pos + robot_vel*t_intercept = algae_pos + algae_vel*t_intercept
```

This yields:
```
t_intercept = ||algae_pos - robot_pos|| / ||robot_vel - algae_vel||
```

With acceleration and deceleration, we use the numerical approach described above.

## Special Cases

### Fast Algae (v_a > v_max)

1. Interception impossible if:
   - Algae is faster than robot's max speed (||v_a|| > v_max)
   - Algae is moving away from robot (dot_product(algae_pos - robot_pos, algae_vel) > 0)
   - Algae has no deceleration (a_a = 0)

2. With deceleration, interception may still be possible if algae slows sufficiently before escaping.

### Moving Away Initially

If robot velocity has a component opposite to the direction to algae:

1. Calculate time to stop: 
   ```
   t_stop = |dot_product(v_r, -direction_to_algae)| / a_r
   ```

2. Calculate new position after stopping:
   ```
   p_new = p_r + v_r*t_stop - 0.5*a_r*t_stop^2*direction_to_algae
   ```

3. Then calculate interception from this new position.

## Numerical Methods

The simulation uses numerical integration with the following approach:

1. Use the same time step (dt) for both prediction and simulation to ensure consistency
2. Track minimum distance between objects to find near-interceptions
3. Use floating-point precision (float64) to minimize numerical errors
4. Pre-calculate the predicted robot path for accurate navigation

## Waypoint Following Navigation

To ensure precise interception, the robot follows a pre-calculated path:

1. The complete trajectory to the interception point is pre-calculated
2. At each time step t, the robot aims for the predicted position at that time
3. Speed is dynamically adjusted based on remaining distance and time
4. This approach compensates for numerical errors and ensures accurate arrival

This time-based waypoint following is provably more accurate than simply aiming at the final interception point, especially when dealing with moving targets.
